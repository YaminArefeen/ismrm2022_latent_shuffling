Demonstration code for the ISMRM abstract "Learning compact latent representations of signal evolution for improved shuffling reconstruction".

'dictionary_compression' contains files to run the experiments for Figure 2

'simulation_reconstruction' contains files to run the experiments for Figure 3

Data for 'simulation_reconstruction" can be downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b7oosi66axwxsd9/AADwax6v94Lh0Ied-HkB0zBda?dl=0.  Place 'for_t2shfl.mat' into path 'ismrm2022_latent_shuffling/simulation_reconstruction/data'.
